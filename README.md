## Brief introduction
Because of the high hardware requirements of deep learning-based pest identification, it is difficult to be deployed in the field in actual agricultural production. This work innovatively uses the Bi-level Routing Attention to reduce model size and improve operation efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, which has positive significance for agricultural production.
